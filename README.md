Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is an implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life written in C using
SDL2. This repository is mostly for me just trying out Git and Github.

To compile the source just run 'make'. Note that you will need to have the
SDL2 library installed. This will create the program 'life'. You can either
supply it with a text file for an initial state, see 'examples' for some
example files to try out. E.g. you can run "./life blinker.txt". If run
with no arguments it will create a random initial state instead.
